# Minimum Set Cover
This is a Java implementation of a backtracking algorithm for the minimum set cover problem.

The input is a set of elements (elems) and a set of subsets of those elements (subElems). The output is the smallest subset of subElems that includes every element of elems.

# Instructions
After cloning the repository, compile and run SetCover.java

You will be instructed to choose the number of integers to cover (this means that the set of integers to be covered will be from 1 to the inputted integer, inclusive).

You will also be instructed to choose the number of subsets. The program will generate a random set of subsets of integers from 1 to the previously inputted number of integers to cover.
